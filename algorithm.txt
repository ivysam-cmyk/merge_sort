1.split the array into half as many times as possible until you get an array with 1 element
2.then compare 2 arrays which are at this point (1) element each
3.the smaller element goes to the index 0 of a new hypothetical array
4.the element/array remaining that was larger goes to the next position in the same hypothetical array 
5.so now the hypothetical array has 2 elements eg. [1,2]
6.compare this array with an array with 1 element eg [5], repeating steps 2-4
7. when comparing 2 arrays with multiple elements(which have been merged), use the first element of each array to compare
8. when one array becomes empty after adding the elements into the hypothetical array, just add all the other elements as is in the other array into the hypothetical array

in the end there are 2 half arrays remaining for which follow steps 3-7
